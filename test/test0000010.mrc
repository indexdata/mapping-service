How will they behave? Answers to these questions depend on the sort of post-war Britain they expect to find. In this report Mass-Observation seeks to relate the anxieties, fears and hopes of these millions to their probable behaviour when the time for demobilisation arrives. The report also suggests ways in which these anxieties may be relieved.  aElectronic reproduction.bMarlborough, Wiltshire :cAM,d2007.nDigitized from a copy held by the Mass Observation Archive, University of Sussex Special Collections.1 aUniversity of Sussex Special Collections.  fMaterial sourced from the Mass Observation Archive, University of Sussex Special Collections.  aDescription based on online resource; title from scanned document's title page (viewed on October 3, 2023).20aMass-Observation (Project : 1937-1960?) 0aReconstruction (1939-1951)zGreat Britain. 0aVeteransxEmploymentzGreat Britain. 0aReconstruction (1939-1951)zGreat BritainxPublic opinion. 0aPublic opinionzGreat Britain.2 aAdvertising Service Guild,eauthor.2 aMass-Observation Archive,eowner.2 aAM (Publisher),edigitiser. 0aMass observation online.403Mass Observation Onlineuhttps://www.massobservation.amdigital.co.uk/documents/detail/the-journey-home-advertising-service-guilds-report-on-the-problems-of-demobilisation-conducted-by-mass-observation/19610838yAdam Matthew  a20170614bPurchased on POs:221760 & 225075, Bib: 11038813  aAdam Matthew: Mass Observation Online  aebooks
